    <ul>
        <li>Which country has the highest proportion of women in parliament?</li>
        <li>Do women vote differently on issues like defence, the environment, or maternity benefits?</li>
        <li>Exactly when did women come into power in different countries, and did their presence change the way the country was run?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Frustratingly, these are questions for which it’s difficult to provide an answer, because the objective data just isn’t there.</p>

    <p>While the <a href="http://www.ipu.org/iss-e/women.htm">Inter-Parliamentary Union</a> does collect figures, they are self-reported, often out of date, and only cover its members.</p>

    <p>So we created Gender Balance, an easy game that crowd-sources gender data across every parliament in the world — and will continue to do so as elections take place and administrations change.</p>

    <h2 class="page-title">What will happen to the results?</h2>

    <p>As the results emerge, we’ll publish them in an open format that’s easy for anyone to pick up and use, for free.</p>

    <p>We hope that they will be useful for researchers, campaigners, politicians, sociologists… and you!</p>

    <h2 class="page-title">Why isn’t every parliament on Gender Balance?</h2>

    <p>Gender Balance takes its data from EveryPolitician, where we’ve included the politicians for every legislature we can find information on. If you know where to find data that we haven’t yet included, please do feel <a href="http://everypolitician.org/contribute.html">free to add it</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="page-title">Who built this?</h2>

    <p>Gender Balance was created by developers at <a href="https://mysociety.org">mySociety</a>, using underlying data from <a href="http://everypolitician.org/">EveryPolitician</a>, a database which aims to collect information on every politician in the world.</p>

    <p>Gender Balance exists to discover the gender balance data across every country.</p>

    <p>But Gender Balance also aims to be a showcase of what can be done with the open data from EveryPolitician. That data is free for anyone who wants to build tools like this, and it’s easy to use, too. <a href="http://everypolitician.org/about.html">Find out more about that here</a>.</p>
